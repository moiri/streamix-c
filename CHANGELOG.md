# `v0.1.0`

### Bug Fixes

### Changes
 - instead of compiling igraph manually use the already prepared deb package

### New Features
 - mark nets that are framed by temporal firewals with a graph attribute
 - introduce the keyword `coupled` which allows to overwrite the default
   decoupling of side output ports and make such a port blocking.
